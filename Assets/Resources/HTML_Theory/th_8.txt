Cycles allow you to perform some action depending on the observance of some condition. The Python language has the following types of loops:
<b><color=#FFFFFF>while,for</color></b>

A condition is specified after the while keyword, and as long as this expression returns True, the block of instructions that follows will be executed.

<b><color=#FFFFFF>Construction:</color></b>
while condition_expression:
    Instructions

<b><color=#FFFFFF>Example:</color></b>
num = 0
while number < 3:
    print("num = {num}")
    num += 1
print("the program is completed")

In this case, the while loop will be executed until the number variable is less than 3 and executed 3 times. 
It is necessary to remember about the 4 indents on the left of calculations inside the loop.
