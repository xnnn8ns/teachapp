Another type of loop is represented by the "for" construction. This loop goes through a set of values, puts each value in a variable, and then in the loop we can perform various actions with this variable.

    Instructions

After the keyword "for" comes the name of the variable in which the values will be placed. Then, after the in operator, a set of values and a colon are specified.
And from the next line there is a block of cycle instructions, which must also be indented from the beginning of the cycle.When executing a loop, Python sequentially gets all the values from the set and passes them to a variable.
When all the values from the set are sorted, the loop ends its work.
As a set of values, for example, you can consider a string that essentially represents a set of characters.

<b><b><color=#FFFFFF>Example:</color></b></b>
mes = "Hello"
 
for c in me—ã:
    print(c)
