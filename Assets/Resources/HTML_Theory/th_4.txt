Sometimes there is a need for a program to compare one with another in order to understand what the program will do next or which variable to take.
Conditional expressions are divided into comparison operators and logical operators.

Comparison operators return True or False values.

<b><color=#FFFFFF>Comparison operators:</color></b>
<b>==</b> Returns True if both operands are equal. Otherwise it returns False.
<b>!=</b> Returns True if both operands are NOT equal. Otherwise it returns False.
<b>></b> (more than) Returns True if the first operand is larger than the second.
<b><</b> (less than) Returns True if the first operand is smaller than the second.
<b>>=</b> (greater than or equal to) Returns True if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.
<b><=</b> (less than or equal to) Returns True if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.

<b><color=#FFFFFF>Example:</color></b>
a = 3
b = 7
res = a == b  # saving the result of the operation to a variable
print(res)  # False - 4 is not equal to 5
print(a != b)  # True
