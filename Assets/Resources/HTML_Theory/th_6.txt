After the program is running, you always want to see the result, what happened there
The output allows you to see, use, and pass on the result of the program.

<color=#FFFFFF>Output function</color> print()
This function displays what it has in parentheses. You can specify specific variables, the number of them can be different

<b><color=#FFFFFF>Example:</color></b>
print(574.4) we will see on the screen 574.4
print("a=", 7) we will see on the screen "a=", 7
print("hello" + " " + "world") we will see on the screen : hello world
print("Hello \n World") On the screen, the word "Hello World" will be written under each other
print(6+5) Will output 11

The arguments of the function (what is in parentheses) are separated by commas. In the output, instead of commas, the values are separated by a space.

<color=#FFFFFF>Input function</color>input()
When this function is called, the program stops its execution and waits for the user to enter something.
After pressing Enter, the input() function will pick up the entered text and pass it to the program.
The entered value can be assigned to a variable.

<b><color=#FFFFFF>Example:</color></b>
a = input()
User_name = input('Your name: ') #The prompt "Your name" will appear on the screen
summa = int(input("How much does it cost? ")) #converting the entered string to an integer

All data entered from the keyboard is considered the "str" data type, even if you enter a number. So that they can be used for calculation in the future, they are converted into numbers.
